# Entry 1 :

When my teacher asked us: "What topic do you want to commit to this whole year?"
A lot of ideas appeared in my mind such as medicine, gaming, neurology, or even zoology. But this one topic stuck to me which was serial killers. I wasn't fond of them killing, but I was really intrigued with their method of killing and their mindset during the time. 

Throughout my teenage years I tend to surf the internet and watch many videos regarding serial killers or even shocking murders in general. Whenever I thought of serial killers I'm incredibly interested, which is why I chose this topic. The forensic science and psychology in general are shocking to figure out, and it provides a mysterious vibe.Reading about serial killers just makes you wonder about why, how, etc. which is why I wanted to study this topic for my freedom project.

For information regarding my research, I'm going to surf the web for more information about many famous serial killer, especially videos that contain information about it. On Youtube, there's this Youtuber called "The Infographics," provides me with information through its infographics; and it tells a story. Along with many other websites, such as articles within the Internet contains a lot of information regarding this topic, especially since many of the cases have been solved. It’s revolutionary to evaluate the information of the killers’ minds and make a deeper connection to their lifestyle.
